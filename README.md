# Proxy Repository

This repository serves as a **proxy** in the public Axel Springer GitHub organization.  
It is required to make the published package available.  

The actual project that publishes the package is located in the internal **spring-media** organization:  
ðŸ‘‰ [spring-media/ps-web-apis](https://github.com/spring-media/ps-web-apis/)

Please make all code changes **there**.  
This repository itself does not contain any logic.
